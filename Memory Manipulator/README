Memory Manipulator is an advanced memory modification tool for MikeOS.

What hobby OS is complete without a memory editor? 
This is a great colourful interface that allows you to see your memory in 
hexadecimal and ASCII characters. 
Most importantly you can make changes and observe the results!
This program can also be useful in viewing/editing binary or non-text files.

  > 3.2.1 minimum
  > 3.2.3 recommended
  > 3.2.1 is included with the latest MikeOS beta image (4.4b3), will work
  > 3.0.2 is included with the latest MikeOS release (4.3.1), will not work
