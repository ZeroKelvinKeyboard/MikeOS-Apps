Yotta is a clone of the famous Linux commandline text editor, nano.

Frustrated working with the MikeOS text editor, I created this 
program, 'Yotta' to be an advanced, yet small and easy to use 
alternative to the MikeOS text editor. I was a proud linux user and
based Yotta on my favorite linux text editor Nano.
However I picked a much greater prefix, Yotta = 10^24.
This is the highest standardized number prefix. It is very big number indeed.

To run Yotta, simple place the binary onto a MikeOS disk and 
select 'yotta.bin' from the CLI menu or type 'yotta' on the
commandline. 

You can also add the name of a file you want to open on launch 
to the end of the command, proceeded by a space i.e. 'yotta example.bas'

Yotta can only open unix formatted plain text files (.TXT) and
BASIC programs (.BAS).

All keyboard shortcut begin with control (^G = Control+G).
You can press the previously mentioned shortcut to get help
while running the program.

Requires MikeOS version 4.4b3 or greater
You can download this MikeOS beta from the mailing lists at:

This program requires the MikeOS BASIC interpreter. 
It may not work on MikeOS derivatives or OS independent
versions of the MikeOS BASIC interpreter.
