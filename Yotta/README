Yotta is a clone of the Linux commandline text editor, nano.

Yotta was created to be an alternative to the default MikeOS text editor. It
is designed to be smooth and responsive and duplicate the all the 
functionality that is available in a modern text editor.
Nano is a small number (10^-9), so I picked a much greater prefix, Yotta = 10^24.
This is the highest standardized prefix in the metric system. A large number indeed.

To run Yotta, simple place the binary onto a MikeOS disk and 
select 'yotta.bin' from the CLI menu or type 'yotta' on the
commandline. 

You can also add the name of a file you want to open on launch 
to the end of the command, proceeded by a space i.e. 'yotta example.bas'

Yotta can only open unix formatted plain text files but will open files with
any extension.

All keyboard shortcut begin with control (^G = Control+G).
You can press the previously mentioned shortcut to get help
while running the program.

Requires MikeOS version 4.5 or greater or any TachyonOS build.
You can download the latest MikeOS build from the MikeOS homepage on
SourceForge at the following URL.

The latest TachyonOS build can be downloaded from GitHub at the following URL.
