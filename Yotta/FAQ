  Q) Why is the binary so big?

  Q) Why does MikeOS freeze/restart when opening my file?
  A) You are limited to a maximum of twenty kilobytes.

  Q) Many features of the Linux version are missing.

  Q) Can you add support for running BASIC programs like the
     MikeOS text editor?

  Q) What language is it written in?

  Q) What's with your unusual version numbering system?
  A) Due to Yotta being the name of a number prefix (10^24)
	I have adopted an unusual version numbering system:
	minor.buildx10^(major-23)
	so the first version would be:
	1.00x10^24
	See 'CHANGES', you'll get the hang of it.
