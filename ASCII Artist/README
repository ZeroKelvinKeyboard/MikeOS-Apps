ASCII Artist is a MikeOS program for creating text artwork.

This program requires the MikeOS BASIC interpreter. 
It may not work on MikeOS derivatives or OS independent
versions of the MikeOS BASIC interpreter.

This program requires the MB++ library.
Version 3.2.2 is recommended, download here:

Library version 3.0.2, included with the stable MikeOS disk images will not work.
Version 3.2.1 as included with the beta builds will work, but it's slightly buggy.
